# autonomy

A personal time management system for breaking down tasks and planning out your days based on complex goals.

## Features

* User Auth - Requires user to log in to view, create, and edit tasks.

* Task Creation - Simple form page for creation (New always editable style shipping next patch.)

* Projects - They hold an entire category (might change name to category) of tasks, for organization

* Sub-Task Creation - For additional organization, creating subtasks is an intuitive way to break down ideas or set up prereqs

* Crossing Off - Users can cross off tasks without deleting them! 

* Deleting - Removing a task from the list, *poof*

* Pinning - You can now pin items to the top of the list.

## In progress Features

* Sorting/ Filtering - Allow for sorting by newest, oldest, or filtering by crossed off.

* Connection with google calendars - So users can schedule their tasks and set up auto cross offs or repeating events.

* Print out task list - self explanatory.

* Mass removal - For those spontanious ones.

* Personal ordering - Each user can choose top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top


### Why it exists now
We believe now is the perfect time for a self governance platform. With the rise of coronavirus, more people are going to elect to become freelancers and will be in charge of their own performance.
